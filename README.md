# P4-Data-Analysis-with-R
This is the 4th project of the Data Analyst Nanodegree offered by Udacity. In this project, I used R and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.
